# UX Case Studies and Personas

In referring to the articles, I place them in this order (the order I read them in):

## Personas (or User Stories)

I believe this image to be the best example of what a persona is:

We meet John Doe, an animal shelter volunteer who wants to order supplies, such as buttons and flyers, to raise animal rights awareness at his school. He wants to purchase designs that promote animal adoption, but he's frustrated at the expenses and hassles of other vendors. Additionally, he's worried about what happens if his funding falls through. He's passionate, motivational, and optimistic. As a 28-year-old PhD student, he never feels like he has enough time, so he'll need something that won't take up too much of his time with red tape.

Attaching a face and a name to these personas make it personal. Rather than simply adding certain features, it feels like you're designing for another person, even if that person is fictional. This works because the personification of the use case helps you empathize with the real life users who will closely model that persona.

The first article focused more on why personas ("user stories") are important, while the second one focused more on actually creating them—what makes a persona work well, how to develop personas that fit your end users.

The second article explains in a practical sense when and why you should develop personas. It also lays out how personas can actually help sell your idea to a client, demonstrating how and why your idea can be successful. A compelling story is a great way to sell an idea.

The second article continues with a detailed description of the process of creating a persona. It's broken down into three steps:

 1. Gather data about your users: Use a combination quantitative and qualitative data, including polls, interviews, surveys, user data from other products, and even shadowing day-to-day activities, to aggregate and visualize your users' needs.
 2. Put the data together: Spreadsheets and other visual aids are useful in representing your segment. Empathy maps are specifically mentioned, where user data is organized into 4 categories: what they see, what they think, how they feel, and what they do.
 3. Create your user persona: With this knowledge, you can start building a persona and filling in the details. Backstory is important here. What is your persona passionate about? What has frustrated your persona in the past? What are their goals? You want to "get to know" your persona in the same way you might get to know a person in real life.

The second article also mentions a less-detailed version, "lean personas." This seems more equivalent to the first article's "user stories." If you're limited on time and budget, you can omit some detail in your persona, providing only fundamental details directly relevant to the product. This creates a less complete picture of the person, and a UX designer may find themself mentally filling in the details independently, but it works when there's little time to create a full-blown persona.

The third article focuses more on how personas fit into the bigger picture of the UX design process. More specifically, it begins out with how personas augment and prevent some common pitfalls of UX design. It continues by discussing how personas integrate into the various stages of the process. Personas are generally created during the "define" phase of UX design and used by all later stages to inform the design process.

It also takes the three steps from the second article, and adds two more:

 4. Find scenarios and document personas: This is where you tell the story of your persona. Where do they start? What is their goal? How will they get there? What challenges will they find along the way?
 5. Share your personas: This is where the personas become members of your team. People on your team should talk about the needs of the personas as if they were real people. It keeps everyone on the same page, and clearly defines the short-term motivations of the design process.

The fourth article discusses common issues with personas.

 1. No buy-in from leadership: For personas to be accepted and impactful across an organization, support needs to come from the top.
 2. Personas were created in a silo and imposed on people: A persona shouldn't be a present the UX team unwraps for the organization on Christmas. Everyone should be invested in the creation of personas, so that way they'll be invested in the needs of them. If it's introduced like a team member, it'll be treated like a team member. If it's introduced like art, it'll be treated like art; forever destined to fade away on the walls of cubicles, never to enter your mind again after the first week or so.
 3. People don’t know what personas are or why they’re useful: It should be made clear what personas are, why they work, and how to embrace them to the entire organization.

Overall, I found the first article to be moderately useful, but the other three were more informative to me.

## Case studies

Case studies are crucial to any portfolio. Not only to they show off your work, they show off your skills, creativity, and know-how.

The article defines 7 parts of a case study:

 1. Overview
 2. Problem statement
 3. Users and audience
 4. Roles and responsibilities
 5. Scope and constraints
 6. Process and what you did
 7. Outcomes and lessons

The article is very well-written, and something I will refer to frequently in my own case studies. It starts off with a broad overview to give you an overall idea of what a case study looks like, and then breaks down into the details of how to write each section. It does this by splitting the sections into 5 steps.

To summarize each step:

 1. Give your UX case study a clear title: A good title is specific enough to clearly communicate what your project is. A common mistake is making the title too short. For example, "Home Depot User Research For Mobile App Checkout" is a much better title than "Home Depot."
 2. Write an outline for your UX case study: Start with an outline to help you plan the structure of the case study. Define the scope of your case study, and evaluate whether you might want to break it up into multiple projects/case studies in your portfolio.
 3. Write the details for your UX case study: This is where the writing happens. Explain everything about your project; what you did, why you did it, and what you learned.
 4. Write the UX case study using only headlines: Write a headline for each section. This will help you slim down your case study.
 5. Distill your case study into a shorter version for your UX portfolio: Use the headlines and your draft to write a final, concise version of your case study.
