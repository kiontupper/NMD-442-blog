# Case studies

## How to write a UX case study

Case studies are crucial to any portfolio. Not only to they show off your work, they show off your skills, creativity, and know-how.

The article defines 7 parts of a case study:

 1. Overview
 2. Problem statement
 3. Users and audience
 4. Roles and responsibilities
 5. Scope and constraints
 6. Process and what you did
 7. Outcomes and lessons

The article is very well-written, and something I will refer to frequently in my own case studies. It starts off with a broad overview to give you an overall idea of what a case study looks like, and then breaks down into the details of how to write each section. It does this by splitting the sections into 5 steps.

To summarize each step:

 1. Give your UX case study a clear title: A good title is specific enough to clearly communicate what your project is. A common mistake is making the title too short. For example, "Home Depot User Research For Mobile App Checkout" is a much better title than "Home Depot."
 2. Write an outline for your UX case study: Start with an outline to help you plan the structure of the case study. Define the scope of your case study, and evaluate whether you might want to break it up into multiple projects/case studies in your portfolio.
 3. Write the details for your UX case study: This is where the writing happens. Explain everything about your project; what you did, why you did it, and what you learned.
 4. Write the UX case study using only headlines: Write a headline for each section. This will help you slim down your case study.
 5. Distill your case study into a shorter version for your UX portfolio: Use the headlines and your draft to write a final, concise version of your case study.

The article concludes with a example of Simon Pan's case study for Uber. This provides a great example of how to apply the principles described in the article.

## How to create the perfect structure for a UX case study

A case study doesn't simply state what you did over time. It's not a timeline. It's a story. It starts off with a quest, a goal, a mission statement. It discusses the adventures and challenges and successes you faced along the way. And it shows off how you saved the princess in the end.

**Introduction:** <i>We wanted to \_\_\_\_\_. The challenges were \_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_. It would be better if \_\_\_\_\_.</i>

**Process:** <i>We looked at \_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_. From this, developed personas, including \_\_\_\_\_, a \_\_\_\_\_ that wants to \_\_\_\_\_. ...</i>

**Conclusion:** <i>Our final product was successful because \_\_\_\_\_. ...</i>

The most important thing about a case study is communication. UX design itself is an exercise in communication, so employers will be expecting your case studies to demonstrate your ability to communicate.


## GNO Blankets

The GNO Blanket case study was a fairly typical commodity brand case study—a small company selling on Amazon wants to create their own independent brand identity and website. As such, it was about what you'd expect.

It starts off by introducing the client: GNO Blankets sells weighted blankets to help people with anxiety sleep. Their project was a complete brand identity, complete with a logo, website, packaging, and a new Amazon product page.

They show three logo concepts with a short blurb described the motivation behind each design. Each design was vastly different, showing a particular direction to take for the final logo. Once they decided on a logo concept, they developed it further into a final logo. They applied this logo to their blanket packaging, and also designed the packaging for a line of branded candles, featuring a minimalistic label and a cork printed with the logo.

Next, they briefly discussed the new Amazon product page. They created new infographics incorporating the new brand.

From here, they moved on to the website, the biggest part of the case study. They start by introducing the motivations of the website (to allow users to quicly see the purpose and benefits of the blanket and make a purchase) and higher-level design concepts (the use of contrasting light and dark backgrounds, the navigation scheme, etc).

The case study goes over the individual design elements that helped the website quickly convey the benefits of the product. Embedded within the descriptions are links to the specific examples being mentioned.

The website is visually appealing (although it leaves a little to be desired from a programming standpoint), and the brand is expressed clearly and concisely.

The only design complaint I have about the website is that they dedicate a whole section to the blanket materials, but they don't actually tell you what the materials are until you click tiny little buttons in the picture. It's clear a lot of thought was put into this section, but the actual descriptions were apparently an afterthought. I think they should have spread out the layers of the image further, and had the user scroll through each one, with each relevant description showing as they scrolled.

## Splitwiser

Splitwiser is a hobby redesign of the [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com) app. This isn't an actual design used by Splitwise.

At first glance, I was pretty excited about this app. But as I paid more attention, my excitement died down pretty quickly. You'll see why.

After a brief introduction, the case study introduces a problem statement: The existing Splitwise app is limited in functionality. It supports splitting equally or by percentages, but does not support more complicated scenarios. He sought out to redesign the app from the ground up and make it more powerful. Annoyingly, he _skips all of the research and design process_, and instead opts to show off the design like a car salesman.

First up: the logo. He reached out to the original designer of the logo. Most notably, the previous logo used a house as a visual metaphor, while the new logo uses a coin.

After this, he shows off how the design onboards the user to the new features of the app. I find it odd that it would go here. I think this should have been saved for the end, in the order he likely actually designed it (features first, then how to show off those features).

Moving on, his actual first order of business is to simplify the task flow for users and reduce the number of steps.

Before, a typical scenario would involve:

 1. Enter description
 2. Choose friends involved
     1. Choose contacts
     2. Enter phone numbers or emails for those who aren't on Splitwise
 3. Choose how it'll be paid
     1. Choose payers
     2. Enter amounts for payers
 4. Choose how to split
     1. Either select "equally" or provide percentages for each person to pay
 5. Settle up outside of the app

The new flow, designed by Chethan is:

 1. Enter description
 2. Choose payers, adding amount paid as you select each one
 3. Choose friends to split with
 4. Choose how to split
 5. Settle up _within_ the app

The highlight of this case study is step 4, choosing how to split. While Splitwise lets you split equally or by percentage, Splitwis<i>er</i> lets you split equally, by amount, by percentage, or by share. There's also an "adjustment" option, but it's not make clear what this does.

After this, Chethan goes beyond the scope of the Splitwise app, adding accounting featuers in-app payments. You can set due dates for splits, and debts will be tallied up to a running balance, so you know at a glance what you owe others, and what they owe you. Notifications tell you when it's time to settle up. On top of this, another notable feature is the ability to save splits as drafts, making it easier to plan ahead while still being able to adjust as necessary.

So what do I think about Splitwiser? I was a little disappointed. The case study doesn't include any UX research, and it shows. The whole case is hard to follow, and took reading it several times before I understood the flow of the app—there's no overall flowchart.

Priorities don't seem to be considered. Chethan fixates on "removing" a step in the process by combining choosing payers with the amounts for the payers. But I think this creates more friction. Let's say you're at a restaurant. You're with 12 friends, and you've decided that everyone should pay for their own food, but it's easier to take three separate bills, say for three different tables. This is how it would work with Splitwiser:

 1. You start off by adding all of your friends. Once everyone has been selected, invitations are sent to anyone who's not already on the app.
 2. You select payers. As you select each one, you have to enter the ammount they will pay before you can move on.
 3. Once that's settled, you can choose how to split. In this case, you'd select the "unequally" option and enter the amounts each person owes by what they put on the bill.

I have an issue with step 3 here. You have to enter the amount for each payer before you can continue to add the next one. This makes no sense. Why can't I just select all of the payers, then split payments using the same split UI used for all participants? In fact, it could benefit with another option where you select who's share each payer will be paying for. This way, if you were at 3 different tables, you could have one payer at each table responsible for their table without needing to do extra math or enter the values twice. You could simply select who's behalf the payer is paying on.

My idea would go like this:

 1. Add all participants.
 2. Select which participants are payers.
 3. Split the total bill between the participants.
 4. Split the total bill between the payers.

I intentionally separate the _setting up the lists of people_ from _dealing with the numbers_. With this sequence, you get the logistics of adding people to the list out of the way right off the bat. Now, you can focus on splitting. It also creates more room to allow advanced splitting options for both participants and payers. By splitting payers after participants, if you decide to split payers based on who they're paying for, you see in real time what the numbers will look like, since the participant split has already been decided by this point. Naturally, the app would skip the payer splitting if only one payer is selected.

To be fair, I haven't done any UX research either. But my point is that less steps doesn't always mean an easier time. Sure, you _can_ fill out amounts as you go. But in doing so, you are constantly switching between finding the person in the list and figuring out what they're responsible for. This isn't a big deal for one or two payers, but the whole point of this redesign is to provide added flexibility for complex scenarios, isn't it?

Chethan developed a very clever splitting system. 4 options is all you'll really ever need: equal split, percentages, shares, and exact amounts (with a built-in calculator/keypad combo to easily add together multiple line items). But he only applied this to half the equation, and I don't understand why. The added friction when actually arranging the payers detracts from the benefits of the new splitting system for participants. He reduced the number of steps, yes. But by forcing two steps to be one, it really becomes several mini-steps and makes the experience worse. But he knows this! That's why he changed the flow for adding friends to worry about phone numbers and email addresses _after_ everyone has been selected. It makes more sense this way! But he did the reverse for selecting payers, and I don't understand why, except to try to get that flowchart one box smaller.

In addition to my issues with selecting payers, I also take issue with how this redesign is supposed to be onboarded. Chethan designed _eight_ splash screens that scream at you right as you open the app. He expects users to absorb this all at once, and then figure it out when they actually use the app. I think this could be better accomplished with 1 or 2 splash screens at the most, to hint at users how to get going. Once they're on track, you can show hints to the new features as the user gets to them. Instead, Chethan's solution screams _"Hey we changed everything so you better get used to it! Because as soon as you close this screen you're on your own!"_

Other parts of the design are great. The groups tab redesign makes it much easier to see what's going on at a glance. This extends to the friends page, spending summaries, and expense details. By highlighting the most important information and reducing clutter, the experience becomes smooth like butter. Small adjustments to the activity tab make it more clear and concise. The actual splitting interfaces is great, offering easy ways to split whatever way you could think of, while also being clear, concise, and easy to use. The things that worked well stayed the way they are, and improvements were made where they were needed.

I just wish the payers section was met with the same philosophy.

## Pasión Del Cielo

This case study is annoyingly provided as a few massive images, rather than an accessible, quotable, and more navigable page. But I digress.

The challenge was to create a mobile order experience for the Pasión Del Cielo coffee shop.

Jonathan Montalvo started off by comparing the local coffee shop with their biggest competitor, Starbucks. They commended Starbucks's brand identity, but criticized the digital ordering experience and the quality of their products. Additionally, they looked at two other local competitors and found the digital ordering experience to be lacking.

He saw Pasión as a conventional, accessible coffee shop with a unique local flavor. He follows up with survey results from local coffee shop customers:

 1. **85%** of respondants were between aged between 17 and 37, confirming the target demographic.
 2. **84%** loved the variety of coffee beans available at Pasión, prioritizing this option as a part of the experience.
 3. **70%** wanted to learn more about coffee, providing an opportunity to enrich the app.
 4. **81%** preferred waiting in line for coffee, which is confusing considering the next part:
 5. **64%** said either an app or an in-store kiosk was the most effective way to order.

To gain a clearer picture of this digital-vs-line ordering, he conducted 5 interviews and found one thing in common: they _preferred_ Pasión Del Cielo, but used Starbucks instead for the convenience of ordering from the app.

Armed with this information, he developed a persona: a 35-year-old analyst who prefers Pasión Del Cielo, but needs the ability to order in advance and pick it up on his way to work, since he can't afford to risk waiting in line.

The goal: To create an app that allows users to order their favorite coffee ahead of time, so they can pick it up on their commute with minimal delay.

The case study goes on to compare mobile app ordering with kiosks, finding that app ordering had a much higher potential demand than a digital kiosk. So, they opted to forgo the kiosk and focus on the app.

The next step is to design a wireframe of the app:

 1. Choose coffee style
 2. Choose bean
 3. Select extras (milk, flavors, sweeteners)
 4. Choose a time and place to pick up
 5. Review order
 6. Check out
 7. See directions to get there

Interestingly, he designed the app layout first, and then designed the brand and color scheme, and used that to finish the actual UI. I think it resulted in a well-designed and intuitive app.

The case study made great use of UX research, both in terms of market research and competitor analysis, and direct user surveys. He carried his learnings throughout the design process, and I think it resulted in a product that fits its purpose very well.
