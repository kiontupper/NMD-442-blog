## How to write a UX case study

Case studies are crucial to any portfolio. Not only to they show off your work, they show off your skills, creativity, and know-how.

The article defines 7 parts of a case study:

 1. Overview
 2. Problem statement
 3. Users and audience
 4. Roles and responsibilities
 5. Scope and constraints
 6. Process and what you did
 7. Outcomes and lessons

The article is very well-written, and something I will refer to frequently in my own case studies. It starts off with a broad overview to give you an overall idea of what a case study looks like, and then breaks down into the details of how to write each section. It does this by splitting the sections into 5 steps.

To summarize each step:

 1. Give your UX case study a clear title: A good title is specific enough to clearly communicate what your project is. A common mistake is making the title too short. For example, "Home Depot User Research For Mobile App Checkout" is a much better title than "Home Depot."
 2. Write an outline for your UX case study: Start with an outline to help you plan the structure of the case study. Define the scope of your case study, and evaluate whether you might want to break it up into multiple projects/case studies in your portfolio.
 3. Write the details for your UX case study: This is where the writing happens. Explain everything about your project; what you did, why you did it, and what you learned.
 4. Write the UX case study using only headlines: Write a headline for each section. This will help you slim down your case study.
 5. Distill your case study into a shorter version for your UX portfolio: Use the headlines and your draft to write a final, concise version of your case study.

The article concludes with a example of Simon Pan's case study for Uber. This provides a great example of how to apply the principles described in the article.

## How to create the perfect structure for a UX case study

A case study doesn't simply state what you did over time. It's not a timeline. It's a story. It starts off with a quest, a goal, a mission statement. It discusses the adventures and challenges and successes you faced along the way. And it shows off how you saved the princess in the end.

**Introduction:** *We wanted to _____. The challenges were _____, _____, and _____. It would be better if _____.*

**Process:** *We looked at _____ and _____. From this, developed personas, including _____, a _____ that wants to _____. ...*

**Conclusion:** *Our final product was successful because _____. ...*

The most important thing about a case study is communication. UX design itself is an exercise in communication, so employers will be expecting your case studies to demonstrate your ability to communicate.


## GNO Blankets

The GNO Blanket case study was a fairly typical commodity brand case studyâ€”a small company selling on Amazon wants to create their own independent brand identity and website. As such, it was about what you'd expect.

It starts off by introducing the client: GNO Blankets sells weighted blankets to help people with anxiety sleep. Their project was a complete brand identity, complete with a logo, website, packaging, and a new Amazon product page.

They show three logo concepts with a short blurb described the motivation behind each design. Each design was vastly different, showing a particular direction to take for the final logo. Once they decided on a logo concept, they developed it further into a final logo. They applied this logo to their blanket packaging, and also designed the packaging for a line of branded candles, featuring a minimalistic label and a cork printed with the logo.

Next, they briefly discussed the new Amazon product page. They created new infographics incorporating the new brand.

From here, they moved on to the website, the biggest part of the case study. They start by introducing the motivations of the website (to allow users to quicly see the purpose and benefits of the blanket and make a purchase) and higher-level design concepts (the use of contrasting light and dark backgrounds, the navigation scheme, etc).

The case study goes over the individual design elements that helped the website quickly convey the benefits of the product. Embedded within the descriptions are links to the specific examples being mentioned.

The website is visually appealing (although it leaves a little to be desired from a programming standpoint), and the brand is expressed clearly and concisely.

The only design complaint I have about the website is that they dedicate a whole section to the blanket materials, but they don't actually tell you what the materials are until you click tiny little buttons in the picture. It's clear a lot of thought was put into this section, but the actual descriptions were apparently an afterthought. I think they should have spread out the layers of the image further, and had the user scroll through each one, with each relevant description showing as they scrolled.

## Splitwiser

Splitwiser is a hobby redesign of the [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com) app. This isn't an actual design used by Splitwise.

After a brief introduction, the case study introduces a problem statement: The existing Splitwise app is limited in functionality. It supports splitting equally or by percentages, but does not support more complicated scenarios. He sought out to redesign the app from the ground up and make it more powerful.

First up: the logo. He reached out to the original designer of the logo. Most notably, the previous logo used a house as a visual metaphor, while the new logo uses a coin.

After this, he shows off how the design onboards the user to the new features of the app. I find it odd that it would go here. I think this should have been saved for the end, in the order he likely actually designed it (features first, then how to show off those features).

Moving on, his actual first order of business is to simplify the task flow for users and reduce the number of steps.

Before, a typical scenario would involve:

 1. Enter description
 2. Choose friends involved
     1. Choose contacts
     2. Enter phone numbers or emails for those who aren't on Splitwise
 3. Choose how it'll be paid
     1. Choose payers
     2. Enter amounts for payers
 4. Choose how to split
     1. Either select "equally" or provide percentages for each person to pay
 5. Settle up outside of the app

The new flow, designed by Chethan is:

 1. Enter description
 2. Choose payers, adding amount paid as you select each one
 3. Choose friends to split with
 4. Choose how to split
 5. Settle up _within_ the app
