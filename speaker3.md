# Will Seyffer

There were several key things I noticed in Will's speech.

## Connections

An important aspect of developing a career is getting yourself noticed, and the easiest way to do this is to build connections. By expanding your network, recruiters are more likely to notice you, opening up potential avenues to progress in your career.

## Facebook Marketplace

Will spent some time discussing the Facebook Marketplace and things that can be learned from how the feature came about.

First up, Facebook Marketplace is a great example studying your users' behavior and identifying unmet need. Facebook looked at their network, and noticed a growing number of buy/sell/trade groups. From seeing the behavior of these groups, they developed a use case, and used UX research to extrapolate the features they needed.

One key point of research was identifying sources of friction resulting in dropouts. Since it's so easy to set up a group on Facebook and communicate with others, people expect using the marketplace to be a _better_ way to do it, so it has to be even simpler than the ad-hoc method. A lot of this comes from balancing how much Facebook asks for with how much they can deliver, or equitable exchange. They need to learn as much as possible to deliver features to allow users to easily find what they want, but they also need to limit what they ask for to make selling a product quicker and easier.

## Brand Identity

Another key subject area was brand identity. It's well-known that Facebook has declined in popularity among younger generations amid bad press, political controversies, and users not wanting to post where their grandparents are. Facebook is primarily responding to this by introducing new specialized social networks, like Facebook Dating, and the college pilot program Will mentioned. Facebook has also notably developed a new unified branding across all of their products, with colorful gradients and a fresh coat of paint across the entire app. Facebook is trying to develop a new identity to try to circumvent the bad taste in their mouth that some users have when thinking about the platform. They're restructuring to become a younger, more agile company. The reasoning behind this is simple: young people bring in more ad revenue. Regardless, only time will tell how well this plan will work.

A caveat with this rebranding is the negative effects it can have on a preexisting brand. For example, when Facebook aquired Instagram, it had to mix enough Facebook features to make the acquisition worthwhile and unify the platform, but they can't change it so much that it turns away existing users. This is an issue they're facing again with the rebranding of Facebook as a whole.

If you look at one of their other apps, like Messenger, the whole brand has been replaced with the new bright gradients, even the Facebook logos. However, the exception is the Facebook website itself. Users are used to seeing the blue F in the corner of their screen, so they took a more conservative approach here. They still freshened the interface a bit, but they kept the classic blue bar and F-in-a-box logo. I'm guessing this was to protect their existing userbase, since otherwise the ideal solution would be to unify the whole brand under one design system.
