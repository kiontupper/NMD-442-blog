 - Connections (knew a Facebook recruiter)
 - Facebook Marketplace (seeing how buy/sell groups were cropping up, researching them, extrapolating into a new feature set)
 - Dropout interviews (car license # example)
 - Equitable exchange (what are we asking, how much is it worth)
 - Facebook college pilot program, Facebook dating, separate experiences - responding to decline in population
 - Relationship between product and brand (facebook: thumb, reactions, post attachments)
 - Dealing with discontinuity between facebook and instagram (preserve basic DNA for "forseeable future", possible slow merge in future, but still incorporate aspects from parent brand, slowly weave together aspects (messenger unified backend), also many instagram/whatsapp users don't realize facebook owns it, can be good and bad, you want to communicate the value the new brand adds, without taking away from what they had)
