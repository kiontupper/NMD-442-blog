## Video - Don Norman on Design Thinking

At the very beginning, Don Norman states that the success of a new idea, no matter how good, takes a very long time. He recalls when Apple first attempted to release a digital camera, the [QuickTake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_QuickTake). Several attempts to release the product failed, because the "world wasn't ready for it." The technology itself wasn't a problem - the limitations weren't unlike what you'd experience with a film camera anyway. The main issue was the surrounding technology. There wasn't an easy way to get the digital image onto a computer and actually use it. Sharing your pictures with other people was an even more tragic story. Imagine how the iPod would have been if iTunes didn't exist. It was easy to see the failure of the product and dismiss it as some lab experiment that never went anywhere.

This statement makes me think of the original iPhone Bluetooth Headset. It was a remarkably compact and lightweight device, especially considering the technology of the day. It wanted to be what AirPods are today. However, it was limited by the surrounding technology. At the time (2007), iPhones had no voice-dialing feature, Bluetooth wasn't as mature as it is today, but I think the real nail in the coffin was that it could _only_ be used for phone calls. Sure, it could be paired via Bluetooth to a desktop, but it was clearly meant to be used with the iPhone, and you could only do that for phone calls. No music, no podcasts, nothing else.

Otherwise than this limitation, the device was extremely comparable to AirPods. Setting it up simply involved plugging it into the same dock with the iPhone, with no manual pairing required. The controls were dead simple: press the only button to accept or end a call, hold it to decline. AirPods achieve the same with double- and triple-taps. And in every way possible at the time, it was seamlessly integrated with the iPhone.

The iPhone Bluetooth Headset was discontinued a short two years after its launch. The world wasn't ready for the wireless-headphone revolution yet. Apple had more success with the launch of the AirPods in 2016 (even though the price surprised some people for a while), and now you can hardly walk anywhere on campus without seeing someone wearing them.

It was a beautifully designed product, peering into the future of what audio-on-the-go would look like. It would just take a decade to get there. This became possible though gradual improvements in the iPhone's capabilities, the capabilities of related technologies (Bluetooth, music/audio streaming, etc), and further iteration on the iPod headset that the iPhone Bluetooth Headset was based on.

After this discussion, he talks about the interactions between designers and executives/management. In order to sell an idea to a manager, a the manager needs to see the added value for both the customer and the company.

> When you're a designer, who's your customer? ... It's actually not your boss. It's the boss of your boss... Your job is to understand the business of the company, and to help the company be successful.

Don discusses his experience at Apple, and notes that every person working for a company sees what they're doing and thinks it's the most important thing in the world at that time. Afterall, why else would they be doing it? But it's also important (and easy to forget) to take a step back, branch out from your own limited perspective, and really think about what's important for the company. Design thinking helps you step back and look at the bigger picture.

Another point which I agree strongly with is to avoid looking specifically at the identity of a person. Instead, your design should revolve around what activities they want to do, not how society groups them with other people. For example, an older retired person probably doesn't want an old "granny car." They probably want something they can take across the country and do whatever they want with their newfound time and money.
