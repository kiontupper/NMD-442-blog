# Dark UX Design Patterns

Looking at the thumbnail of the TechCrunch article immediately reminds me of the short-lived [GDPR hall of shame](https://web.archive.org/web/20180623153852/https://gdprhallofshame.com/), a blog which lasted for 22 posts listing examples of shady practices exposed by the EU [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) from 2018.

A few highlights:

 1. [Tumblr presents a list of 322 "partners,"](https://web.archive.org/web/20180611073755/https://gdprhallofshame.com/22-to-continue-to-use-tumblr-please-check-these-2-000-boxes/) each of which has to be _individually_ opted-out with its own checkbox. There's no "opt-out all" button. You need to click/tap 322 times. Oh, and you'll have to do it again when you use it on a different device.

 2. [Zoom email communications "opt-in"](https://web.archive.org/web/20180623153852/https://gdprhallofshame.com/17-zoom-that-isnt-how-consent-works/) isn't really an opt-in. I'll let the screenshot speak for itself.

 3. Perhaps the most ironic is [TechCrunch parent company Oath's response](https://web.archive.org/web/20180528093119/https://gdprhallofshame.com/5-techcrunch-engadget-and-oath-cookie-gore/).

    You get presented with a wall of text, which notably says: "Select 'OK' to continue using our products, otherwise you will not be able to access our sites and apps," immediately followed by "Select 'Manage options' to set your data use and sharing choices." After clicking "Manage options," it doesn't get better.

    _Again_, we have _another_ generic consent screen that says you have to click OK, and then shows an even smaller link that actually might be something useful.

    And now we get to see what they were hiding. Literally hundreds of data partners, all of which are opted-in by default. At least there's a "deselect all" button.
    
    If you had selected "OK" on either of the previous screens, as it strongly encouraged you to do, you would have "opted-in" to all of these partners processing data without even realizing it.

But all of these pale in comparison to the worst. This is the cracken of software. It makes Tumblr seem private. And it's on over 75% of desktop computers.

### Windows

Windows 10, the $100 propriety software used by over a billion people, has some of the worst practices I have ever seen.

After going through the installation process, _setup_ begins.

The first screen you see is this:

Get going fast! Just say "do whatever you want" and get to using your computer faster! Don't bother with those pesky settings and _options_! Send Microsoft and _trusted partners_ your location? Why? Because you want to! See it's the big blue "Express settings" button!

Oh wait you want to actually have control? Where's waldoâ€”I mean where's the customize settings link?
