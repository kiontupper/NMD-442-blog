# The Basics of User Experience Design

The author does an excellent job at explaining the role of a UX designer. In designing a product, you consider what the goal of the user is, and provide a pathway for the user to accomplish the goal with minimal friction.

However, I think they could gone into the diversity of usage scenarios. It's not as simple as "Okay, we'll add a button to do that," because different users will have different goals, motivations, and assumptions about your product. Every user wants a different thing, has a different set of experiences and intuitions, and has different preferences for how they want to do things. The goal of UX design is to design a product that's broad enough to address the full target audience, while also catering to the needs and expectations of an individual.

Elaborating on this would make a gentle segue into the discussion of empathy in design thinking, and this only takes a short paragraph to introduce.

I also found the course advertisements at the end of Part I to be a major distraction, to the point where I actually thought I was at the end of the piece until I looked at the scroll bar on the side of my screen. This is something that should have been saved for the end. In fact, I think it would sell better at the end, because the design thinking section is superb, and I expect that reading it before being bombarded with advertisements would open someone up to signing up for the extra content.

As mentioned, the design thinking section is very informative and concise. In reading this section, I understood two extremely important aspects of design:

  <dt>Empathy</dt>
  <dd>Empathy allows you to place yourself in the perspective of the user. It's important to develop a scenario of a user who has never downloaded or heard of your product before. What should be the first thing they see? How will you introduce them to your product? How will you distinguish yourself before they lose interest? Once they've decided to use your product, how will you show how to use it? How will you encourage discovery? These are all things that require a designer to remove themself from the perspective of the company, and instead adopt the perspective of a consumer.</dd>

  <dd>Trying to reinvent the wheel is an easy trap to fall into. Snapchat is a grade-A citizen of ignoring the rules and established expectations and doing whatever the heck you want. Well here's an open letter to Snap: <i>For all of mankind, </i><b><i>please</i> read the design guidelines for each platform. Read <a href='https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/'>Apple's</a> for iOS, and <a href='https://material.io/design'>Google's</a> for Android.</b> And if anybody tells you it's harder to use standard system interface elements, grab a fire extinguisher for the pants that are on fire.</dd>
