# Tim Brown on Design Thinking

In _Tim Brown urges designers to think big_, Tim Brown raises several points which I agree with.

## Think about the whole picture

This was a more subtle point hidden within the previous point. He doesn't spend much time on this, but I believe it's one of the stronger points of the video if you flesh it out a bit. Design isn't about focusing on specifically the product you are working on. You also need to pay attention to the bigger picture, how it interacts with everything else.

Tim Brown metions hearing aids for developing countries. Normally, hearing aids are fitted using a specialist. If you set out to provide better access to hearing aids to developing countries, reducing the cost and distributing devices isn't enough. You also need to make the device practical. How can a hearing aid be "affordable" if the appointment required to use it isn't? You can't just solve problems with the device itself, you also need to design for the constraints of the environment the device will be used in.

This context-aware design can be leveraged to create something that's greater than the some of it's parts. By designing multiple different parts to work together seamlessly and compound on the benefits of each other, this can create an experience that not only complements the whole experience, but creates a positive perception around the individual components, even if they are useless when they're apart.

Tim Brown uses Isambard Kingdom Brunel as an example, describing the vision of an fully-connected end-to-end travel network; the idea of getting on a train in London, and getting off a boat in New York. This end-to-end experience creates something greater than the some of its parts. You're not paying for a train ride and a boat ticket. You're paying for the route between London and New York. The inner details are simply a means to an end. So it wouldn't make sense to design a ship that's styled completely different from the train. This would be quite jarring for passengers, as they have to make a major adjustment in the middle of their trip.

Take Apple for example. The Apple Watch is a limited product on it's own, especially in the earlier generations. If Apple was designing the watch by itself, they only came up with an impractical, overengineered, expensive FitBit. What allows the Apple Watch to hold its own is the way it pairs seemlessly with an iPhone. Notifications from an iPhone (from any app, even if it doesn't support the watch) will appear on the watch. Music playing on an iPhone can be controlled with the watch. Fitness and health data from the watch is always synchronized with the phone.

Apple hasn't merely designed a collection of products. They've designed an ecosystem. A movie rental purchased on a MacBook can be played on an Apple TV streaming sound to a pair of connected HomePods, all controlled from the couch by a phone in your hand or a watch on your wrist. Decide to take it to bed? Simply "handoff" from the TV to the iPad and take it with you.

In the end, this revolves around _empathy_. It requires an understanding of exactly what role your product will have in a world full of attention-seeking products. How will your user transition from one product to another? This applies to other products within your company (e.g. transferring music from a Mac to an iPod) as well as outside your company (e.g. transferring music from a PC to an iPod).

## Use prototypes and experiment

The way Tim Brown introduces this topic says it all:

> Prototypes speed up the process of innovation, because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world that we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses. And the faster we do that, the faster our ideas evolve.

He mentions the Aravind Eye Institute, and their breakthrough around intraocular lenses. By building a basic factory in the basement of a hospital, they cut costs significantly and got their product out to the world. Having done this, they were able to scale over time to move into a custom factory, but they didn't try to push for the factory early on. They focused on making a product and getting it out there. From that, they had the opportunity to take what they learned from their _real world experience_ with the product, as well as the capital raised in the meantime, and achieve cost-effective full-scale production.

## Everyday people should influence design

> Design may have it's greatest impact when it's taken out of the hands of designers and put in the hands of everyone.

Kaiser Permanente is a good example of this. They wanted to explore how they could improve the experience for the patient when nurses change shifts. Previously, nurses would retreat to the nurse's station to discuss patient conditions and needs. This would result in about 40 minutes where the patient was left alone.

Through prototyping and rapid iteration, they developed a new system, with the help of software, the nurses would exchange information in the room with the patient. This brought the shift-change time where the patient was left alone down to 12 minutes, greatly improving the patient experience.

## Design thinking is becoming even more important

Tim Brown starts off the video talking about this, but I've decided to put it last to make more sense with the conclusion of the video.

Tim points out how design thinking was applied in cities and infrastructure in the 19th and 20th centuries. But as consumerism has flourished, it's become more of a commodity. The designs of roads and bridges and cities are largely already established. Sure, architects still get to flex their ego by pushing materials to the limits and building the tallest skyscraper or the "sleekest" mansion, but the _fundamental_ infrastructure of society—roads, utility vehicles, common buildings, etc.—are fairly well-established. The real money goes towards designing glasses and blenders and washing machines, things that may be important to a particular person, but won't actually change the course of the human race.

But this is starting to change. The issue of climate change is more urgent than ever. The pandemic has significantly reshaped productivity among the white collar workforce. Political unrest has unveiled a strong need to rethink the way we disseminate information.

We're in a unique situation where several fundamental aspects of our society are being upended, much like it was during the industrial revolution. The digital revolution presents us with more information, good or bad, than we've ever seen before. Worldwide logistics has become an efficient, well-oiled machine as the demand for shipping and importing goods is higher than it's ever been. Self-driving cars and other emerging transportation technologies provide us with an opportunity to completely rethink how the road system works. And perhaps biggest of all, if a little more distant, is the reality that we're now starting to seriously think about the practical implications of extending the human race away from this planet and to the moon, Mars, and elsewhere.

These things (well some of them) are not distant 20 or 30 year changes. These changes are happening _now_. Today, as you read this, there is an AI that can [respond to human philosophical essays about itself](https://twitter.com/raphamilliere/status/1289129723310886912), [translate the wording of legal documents](https://twitter.com/michaeltefula/status/1285505897108832257), and [write analytical essays](https://twitter.com/Anthonyemberley/status/1287560874249474048). Technology is reshaping society at a breakneck pace, and the importance of design thinking on the large scale is as important as it ever was.

## Questions

 - When is the designer right and when is the user right? For example, Apple is well known for deciding what's best without necessarily worrying about what the users want, and it seems to have worked. But in many cases, user input has resulted in massive success. So, what's the balance here? Is Apple an unrealistic example at this point? Or is there something to be learned from their controversial philosophy?
 - If someone in the 19th century was already thinking about a unified transportation experience, why hasn't it gained any traction? While it is true that time tables are well-managed in some cases, going from a plane to a train to a subway is hardly a simple experience, generally requiring multiple forms of payments, working with several companies, and reserving different tickets from different companies, hoping and praying along the way that all of the tickets are avaiable at the right times you need them. Travel booking sites help this experience somewhat, but there's still a significant disconnect between multiple forms of transportation, and sometimes even between different areas for the same company. (Has anyone tried to take an Amtrack from Maine to New York?) Howcome transportation has largely been abandoned for the past few decades, only seeing the light of day recently as electric and hydrogen-powered prototype vehicles are cropping up?
 - I mentioned above how the road system might see significant revision within the next few decades as self-driving cars and robotaxis penetrate the market. How will the design challenges of roads change? It seems at first thought that a future robocar road would need to prioritize throughput and efficiency, without much concern over ease of navigation, but this presents its own set of challenges. How will emergency vehicles be handled? Perhaps they could recieve a dedicated lane and separate bypasses at intersections? How will the costs of this be managed? How can the existing road network be inexpesively retrofitted to take advantage of the cooperative capabilities of self-driving vehicles? Will human drivers be allowed on these new roads at all?
