# Post 1 - Empathetic Design and Dark UX Patterns

Two questions for this week:

1. How can you ensure that your design is flexible and adjustable enough to be approachable by anybody? How can you identify the issues various people have and fix them? What if focus groups don't reach a broad enough audience? How can you tell that you're not doing enough user research?

2. How do you avoid the slippery slope of the guiding the user to what they want (e.g. if a user already knows they want to use your app, it should be obvious at a glance what they need to do), while trying to avoid pushing the user too hard? How can you "fast-track" the experience to reduce friction, without going pushing the user to go "too fast" so they don't really know what they're getting into?
