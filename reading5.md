## The Complete Guide to UX Research Methods

This article lays out UX plainly as a way to understand how users think and behave. It explores the contrast between quantitative and qualitive research. I've seen some confusion about this in the class, though. And I think this is partly because the article elaborates each in overwhelming detail, while not focusing on the actual, concrete difference between "qualitative" and "quantitative." It never answers the question: "in one sentence, what's the difference between qualitative and quantitative research?" Instead, the article discusses Google Analytics and its surrounding ecosystem, which distracts from the point it's actually trying to convey. Google Analytics is a good example of quantitative research, but diving into Data Studio and Google Optimize is unnecessary and confusing. The qualitative section is more concise, and in my opinion, much easier tounderstand.

The cost comparison after this does help put into perspective the challenges of research, especially before a product already has an established market. It's much harder to gather large quantities of quantitative data when you don't already have a product to pull the data from.

The breakdown of each method is the best part of the article. The list is thorough, and each one is followed by a clear, concise description of what it is, with helpful links to more information.

The article continues with a diagram showing how various UX research techniques fit into the iterative design process. Some visual elements of the diagram make little sense, and I would rather have had the list above it be organized into categories, rather than simply listed all at once separately. The notes about "activites" are helpful in figuring out how to accomplish the overall goal of UX research.

The article concludes by summarizing why thorough UX design research is good for business and helps your product succeed. It lays out the objective benefits to UX design research, encouraging more companies, big and small, to invest in it.

Overall, I think it's a great article. The qualitative/quantitative distinction is confusing, but the main point of the article—the list of UX research methods—is clear and easy to understand. The diagram about the stages of UX design research helps understand how the abstract concept of "learning from your users" is executed in practice.

## Complete Beginner’s Guide to UX Research

This article focuses does a better job at conveying the distinction between _gathering_ data and _using_ it. Collecting data is the easy part. It gets hard when you actually have to analyze and use that data in a meaningful way to improve your product. Not only do you have to interpret the data and understand what works and what doesn't, you have to generalize that knowledge across your entire userbase. This article also defines the terms quantitative and qualitative in a much clearer way.

Something I also like better about this article is it elaborates more on the stages of design. The previous article lists everything, and then dumps where it goes on you in a diagram. This one feels more like a walkthrough of what the process actually looks like.

It breaks it down into three stages, observation, understanding, and analysis. Observation is collecting the data and organizing it. Understanding is using that data to put yourself in your users' shoes. Analysis is using your knowledge to inform the design process.

The article follows this by going into detail over specific observation techniques. While there are only a handful of examples here, there is much more detail about what they are, how they are used, and most importantly, how different variations can be used to benefit your use case (e.g. directed, non-directed, and ethnographic interviews). This section dives into detail about how and why each method is used—something missing from the previous article.

This is my second favorite article of the three. It's well-written, thorough, and detailed, while also doing a better job at not overwhelming you with information. The sequence makes logical sense, and it remains focused on what's important to know without distractions.

## A Comprehensive Guide To UX Research

> User-centered design requires research.

This article is the best at describing the overarching goal of UX design research. It frames it as the answer to three questions: What do your users want to get done? What are their goals? What are they trying to achieve?

It also clarifies that user research starts at the beginning of the project, which is important since it's easy to think you can release a product, slap some Google Analytics on it, and fix it later. But when you hobble something together without doing any research, you can end up taking an entirely wrong direction and you may find yourself needing to start from scratch when it's already too late.

It also synthesizes the iterative cycle of design in a clean way, although it doesn't elaborate further on the subject.

This is the most informative image across all of the articles. The brief definitions of qualitative, quantitative, behavioral, and attitudinal are too short and confusing. I'd argue that the definitions for qualitative ("exploring opinions") and quantitative ("testing opinions by exploring data"), are borderline at best and simply wrong at worst. Qualitative repesents data that is descriptive. Sure, in design it tends to be opinionated, but that's not what makes it qualitative. Quantitative represents data in quantities; countable, computable numbers. Here, "testing opinions by exploring data" is very wrong. "Testing opinions" makes no sense here, and "exploring data" could be quantitative or qualitative. But I digress.

The image itself is very useful. It neatly provides a visual representation of the fundamental differences between various methods, providing an intuitive insight as to why some are used over others in different scenarios.

The article gets very useful at this point. It goes through each method, discussing them in detail. For each method, the theory and methodology of the research is dicussed, as well as how it tends to play out in real life. In some cases, links for further reading are also included. This section provides a plethora of information, listing 3 methods for qualitative research and 3 for quantitative research.

The article continues with helpful tips to keep in mind throughout the design process, and discusses how to combine and utilize data from multiple sessions of research.

All in all, I believe this article is the most informative of the three. The introduction is a little long-winded—someone who's reading this much detail about UX research probably doesn't need 5 paragraphs to be sold on it-but the rest of the article more than earns the title "A Comprehensive Guide To UX Research."

## Questions

 1. How do you select a representative user group? What happens when you can't tell if your focus groups or survey participants or other subjects are actually representative of your potential audience?
 2. Is there a standard model for research? The articles discuss many methods, but are there scenarios (even if it's only certain scenarios ones like advertising) where there's a definitive "do this, then this, then that" for UX research?
 3. What happens when UX research methods conflict with each other. Let's say eye tracking indicates one design is far superior, but users always chose the other way around in card sorting? Which do you go with? The arguably more scientific solution? Or the solution that's more directly based off of feedback from your users? You could try A/B testing, but often times the "new" design always is received poorly simply because it's not what existing users are used to. So what else can you do?
