## Video - Don Norman on Design Thinking

At the very beginning, Don Norman states that the success of a new idea, no matter how good, takes a very long time. He recalls when Apple first attempted to release a digital camera, the [QuickTake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_QuickTake). Several attempts to release the product failed, because the "world wasn't ready for it." The technology itself wasn't a problem - the limitations weren't unlike what you'd experience with a film camera anyway. The main issue was the surrounding technology. There wasn't an easy way to get the digital image onto a computer and actually use it. Sharing your pictures with other people was an even more tragic story. Imagine how the iPod would have been if iTunes didn't exist. It was easy to see the failure of the product and dismiss it as some lab experiment that never went anywhere.

> Most radical innovations fail, and the ones that do succeed take decades.

This statement makes me think of the original iPhone Bluetooth Headset. It was a remarkably compact and lightweight device, especially considering the technology of the day. It wanted to be what AirPods are today. However, it was limited by the surrounding technology. At the time (2007), iPhones had no voice-dialing feature, Bluetooth wasn't as mature as it is today, but I think the real nail in the coffin was that it could _only_ be used for phone calls. Sure, it could be paired via Bluetooth to a desktop, but it was clearly meant to be used with the iPhone, and you could only do that for phone calls. No music, no podcasts, nothing else.

Otherwise than this limitation, the device was extremely comparable to AirPods. Setting it up simply involved plugging it into the same dock with the iPhone, with no manual pairing required. The controls were dead simple: press the only button to accept or end a call, hold it to decline. AirPods achieve the same with double- and triple-taps. And in every way possible at the time, it was seamlessly integrated with the iPhone.

The iPhone Bluetooth Headset was discontinued a short two years after its launch. The world wasn't ready for the wireless-headphone revolution yet. Apple had more success with the launch of the AirPods in 2016 (even though the price surprised some people for a while), and now you can hardly walk anywhere on campus without seeing someone wearing them.

It was a beautifully designed product, peering into the future of what audio-on-the-go would look like. It would just take a decade to get there. This became possible though gradual improvements in the iPhone's capabilities, the capabilities of related technologies (Bluetooth, music/audio streaming, etc), and further iteration on the iPod headset that the iPhone Bluetooth Headset was based on.

## Article - User-Centered Design

I find the epiphany that Don had about everyday objects interesting. The way that our brains develop a map between design features and functionality, allowing us to easily identify various objects without even realizing it. Don Norman believed that form follows function. Discoverability is the most important.

Discoverability is driven by a feedback loop. A user observes a new interface, identifies characteristics ("affordances") and hints ("signifiers"), and uses that to mentally build a map between the interface and its underlying functionality. In doing so, the user is rewarded with feedback which (A) communicates what resulted from their action, (B) validates their conceptual model, and (C) sparks curiosity and encourages further exploration.

This is successful because it transforms the user's role from a chore to an experience. Achieving and maintaining this positive feedback loop engages the user and allows them to quickly take full advantage of the interface. Unfortunately, this can be hard to achieve. I find a common issue is that products dump users into a swarm of features, presenting everything you have to offer at once. The feedback loop relies on the user being able to focus on only one or two things at a time, use the knowledge to build their conceptual model, and then move on from their. However, this turns into a balancing act. You want to gradually show the user new features, but you also don't want to hold back users that want to learn quickly.

If I get a device, knowing ahead of time what it can do, I probably have some idea of how I want to use it, and what I want to do with it. So, when I start using it, I'm going to be looking for particular things I'm interested in, and I don't want to be hand-held through a long winding maze before I finally get to the feature I want. Guiding someone through a maze doesn't make it any less of a maze.
